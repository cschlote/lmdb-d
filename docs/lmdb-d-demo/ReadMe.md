This is a demo program for the lmdb D language binding

The binding is directly derived from the official lmdb header files.

Some OO style code was ported from the lmdb++ header. See for
original headers in the docs directory. 

A small demo application is provided in the docs directory. It was used
for some explorative testing of the API binding.
