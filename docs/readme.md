This directory contains the original header files for liblmdb, which were
used to create the D bindings.

lmdb.h is part of the liblmdb package and was created by Howard Chu, 
Symas Corporation. See his license on <http://www.OpenLDAP.org/license.html>.

lmdb++.h is part of a C++ binding written by Arto Bendiken <arto@bendiken.net>.
See https://sourceforge.net/projects/lmdbxx/ for reference and license.

As the D bindings are derived work, they are published under the same license
restrictions as the original work.
